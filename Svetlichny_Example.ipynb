    "In this notebook we explain how to test Svetlichny and Mermin inequalities in a quantum processor. For that goal, we use the Braket SDK to produce some states and the associated circuits needed to test nonlocality inequalities in both, local simulators or real quantum processors. These developments are based on the research presented in [Granda Arango, A. et al, Physical Review A, in press, 2025; https://journals.aps.org/pra/accepted/10.1103/8nbw-bvj2 ; arXiv:2405.01650v3 [quant-ph]].\n",

    "This notebook is organized following the setps below. hola\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) First, we show how to create quantum states. We start with the GHZ states, and then provide a function for creating quantum random circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Next, we build all the functions needed for the formulation of the nonlocality inequalities studied here (Mermin and Svetlichny). Given an input circuit producing the quantum state $\\rho$, using these tools one can compute the angles of maximal violation of Svetlichny (or Mermin) inequality and, with those angles, build the circuits that emulate the local spin measurements used to compute the corresponding correlation terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Once the numerical calcultation in (1) and (2) are done, we are ready to implement the inequaltiies tests in local simulators or actual QPUs. Here we show how to do the evaluation in noiselss and noisy simulators, and briefly indicate how to run the circuits in an actual QPU."

    "Given a quantum state $\\rho$ and the Svetlichny inequality, the evaluation of the modulus of the mean value of $\\rho$ on the Svetlichny operator depends on the angles of the local spin measurements (see discussion in [Granda Arango, A. et al, Physical Review A, in press, 2025; https://journals.aps.org/pra/accepted/10.1103/8nbw-bvj2 ; arXiv:2405.01650v3 [quant-ph]]). Thus, for a given state, we compute the angles of maximal violation in what follows. These angles, together with the corresponding circuit preparing the state to be tested, will be the inputs of the functions SVL_circuits and Mermin_circuits, which produce the circuits used to measure the correlations appearing in the corresponding inequality. We do this for each state of the list defined in (2.1)."
